### Reprothon 2021

**What it's about:**
This is Aberdeen study group's version of a hackathon which is an event where people from diverse backgrounds come together to solve a coding or programming problem.
The Reprothon will aim to answer questions surrounding the longevity and reproducibility of code by working through queries available on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and testing whether the accepted answer still works. Each participant will submit their results through a simple form which will be collated into a master spreadsheet, the event will be tracked live and after the closing date the admin team will analyse the results.

**Who is it for:**
This event is open to anyone, the more participants we have the more code we can test so please share far and wide!

**Language:**
R

**What you need:** 
To register for the event please click [here](https://forms.gle/NTCNZYV9tTUgxznU6), you will then receive a confirmation email with your unqiue reprothon ID!

As this event will be focused on testing code reproducibility there may be a few things you would like to consider:
- A good internet connection
- R version 4.0+ (if you need to update R you can do that following the guide [here](https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/installR.html))
- Ability to install packages in R (if you are using a university PC or laptop you may not have the required privileges to do this, so contact you IT department)
