# **How to Access the Microsoft Teams Community for the Aberdeen Study Group**

Due to the isolation measures that mean we can no longer work together within the University of Aberdeen, we, at the Aberdeen Study Group, wanted to offer you a chance to interact with your peers and get some support from your colleagues whilst trying to conduct your awesome research independently! If you have accessed this tutorial you should have been provided with the link to access our new community on Microsoft Teams, if not feel free to tweet us @abdnStudyGroup to get involved!

Bear in mind before you start that we have a few rules of engagement that we would like you to follow:
1. **Be confident!** This is a group without judgement. Feel free to post your queries or reply to someone elses comment as needed. This is a community for us all to use to support each other.
2. **Be kind!** Make sure to treat all your peers with respect. It can take courage to post something publicly and this group is designed to help people out in what is likely to be an incredibly isolating time!
3. **Be creative!** If you think you have found something that might help others in the community feel free to share it with everyone! The Aberdeen Study Group is here to support open science of **any kind** - it's not just for coding!

That's enough from us! Follow the screenshots below for a whistlestop tour on how to get started with this software and the group:
