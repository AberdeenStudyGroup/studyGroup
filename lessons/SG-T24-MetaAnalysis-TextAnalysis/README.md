### What you can do with existing data: an introduction to text mining and meta analysis. 

**What it's about:**
In this session, Francesca Gray and Rosie Baillie will be talking to us about what we can do with existing data. In the first half of the session Rosie will talk about 
text analysis using data from social media and how it might be useful to your research. Francesca will take the second half to talk about meta analysis and how she is 
using it to look at tissue distributions of organic pollutants in wild bird populations.

**Language:**
R

**Who is it for:**
Anyone who wants to learn about how existing data can be used as part of your research, and to find out more about meta analysis and text mining.

**What you need**
You don't need anything, but if you want to do Rosie's tutorial in your own time, you will need access to R.
