The Reprothon is ASG’s very own hackathon! A hackathon is an event where lots of people come together to work on a coding or programming problem; in this case: what factors affect the reproducibility of R code. 

To do this, participants will work through queries taken from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), checking whether or not the accepted answer still works. Each participant will input this into the master [spreadsheet](https://aberdeenstudygroup.github.io/Reprothon2021/sheet.html) along with details such as the package used. We will track our progress live, and after the closing date, the organisers will analyse this data and produce a blog with our findings.


### Your role as a `Contributor`

Contributors are volunteers who offer their time and expertise to the hackathon project. All contributions are central to the project as they move work forward by leaps and bounds! 

As a contributor you might: 

- add your own unique perspective to the project plans and ideas
- help with the research 
- create graphics an mock ups
- contribute code 
- contribute mock data for testing out code

You should be aware that all contributions to the project will fall under the project's [license](https://github.com/AberdeenStudyGroup/Reprothon2021/blob/main/LICENSE) and can be reused, remixed and shared according to that license. 

### Sharing your story

Part of the “open” nature of the hackathon is connecting and sharing our work, processes and experiences. During the event, we encourage you to post updates– both in the MS Teams chat, and on social media.
