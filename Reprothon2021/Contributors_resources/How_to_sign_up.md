Registration is now open for the Aberdeen Study Group Reprothon! The Reprothon officially starts on the 9th June 2021, 16:00 – 18:00 UK time. During those two hours, we will be hosting an event in Microsoft Teams where you can work alongside others and ask questions. Don’t worry if you can’t join during those hours, the Reprothon will be live until further notice so you can take part at a time that suits you. 

### How do I sign up?
All you need to do to sign up for the Reprothon is to fill out our [<span style="color: blue">event registration form</span>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnZ58LT9lgCHWgHK0JFD-1CPEOyZPcWdCM3VBxDdnXDgQ_AA/viewform). You will then be sent a unique user identification code which you will need to use when submitting your results. 

You should be aware that all contributions to the project will fall under the project's [<span style="color: blue">license</span>](https://github.com/AberdeenStudyGroup/Reprothon2021/blob/main/LICENSE) and can be reused, remixed and shared according to that license.

### What will I do?
The aim of the Reprothon is to understand the longevity and reproducibility of R code by going through queries from  [<span style="color: blue">StackOverflow</span>](https://stackoverflow.com/) to identify whether or not the accepted answer still works. You can find out more info about why we are doing this on the [<span style="color: blue">main Reprothon page</span>](https://aberdeenstudygroup.github.io/studyGroup/Reprothon2021/).  

When the Reprothon has started you will be allocated one query at a time via our website - the link will be published when the Reprothon begins. Your job will be to work through that query to find out whether or not the accepted answer still works. Once you've done that, you will upload your results via a Google Form, and you can move on to another query - you can do as many as you like! 

If you want to make your contribution to Reprothon more interactive, why not set up a team with your friends or colleagues? You will all still use your individual ID when submitting results but could set up a working space for you and your group to chat together as you work through your queries. If you don’t have a team but would like to join one, let us know by emailing <aberdeenstudygroup@gmail.com> and we’ll pair you with someone! 

A detailed how-to guide will be published to take you through the process step-by-step. If you have any questions, we will be around to help you out in the Microsoft Teams channel or via social media. 


### Sharing your story
Part of open science is connecting and sharing our work and experiences. We encourage you to post updates in the MS Teams chat and on social media. If you’re on Twitter, you can use and follow the `#Reprothon2021` and `#Hackers2021` hashtags to share your experience and see what others are up to.
