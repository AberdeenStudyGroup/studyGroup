Hello fellow Hacker,

this short guide shows you how to contribute to the Reprothon 2021.
The aim of the Reprothon is to test whether the accepted answers to questions on StackOverflow are reproducible or not.

Check out the general data generating process below.

## How to Contribute

**1. Sign up for Reprothon event**

**2. Check your email for your personal ReprothonID**

**3. Check your email for the link to the Question_ID_Generator and the Google Form "Reprothon2021_data_entry**

The email will also contain a link to the Google Form Reprothon2021_data_entry that you please fill out for every question you answer.

**4. Check your R Version before you start**  

Before you start reproducing examples on StackOverflow, please check if you have R Version 4 installed.
If you use RStudio, your R Version should show up when you start RStudio.

Otherwise use the R.Version function to check:

> `R.Version()`
