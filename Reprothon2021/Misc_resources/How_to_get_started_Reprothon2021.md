**Check your R Version before you start**  

Before you start reproducing examples on StackOverflow, please check if you have R Version 4 installed.
If you use RStudio, your R Version should show up when you start RStudio.

Otherwise use the R.Version function to check:

> `R.Version()`

In case you have an earlier Version than 4, follow this link to update your R version: <https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/installR.html>


### Now you're ready to get started! The process is simple!

1. Click **`Get a New Sample`** to obtain a Question Link from “Question Generator”
2. The link will take you to a question in Stack Overflow. Try to reproduce the accepted answer in R.
3. Fill out the Google Form “Reprothon2021 Data Entry” with your results
