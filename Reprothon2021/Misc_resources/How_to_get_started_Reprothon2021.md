Hello fellow Hacker!

This short guide shows you how to get set up to contribute to Reprothon 2021.
The aim of the Reprothon is to test whether the accepted answers to questions on [<span style="color: blue">StackOverflow</span>](https://stackoverflow.com/) are reproducible or not.


## How to Get Started

**3. Check you know how to access the Question Generator and the “Reprothon2021 Data Entry” Google form**  

Open up the links to the [<span style="color: blue">Question Generator</span>](https://shiny.abdn.ac.uk/biostat/Reprothon/) and [<span style="color: blue">Google form</span>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnkiWlEgSmdAfwQjN-AvkqPmjAMi-D947jAr2YcABiEMYU9g/viewform) in your browser, it may be handy to keep them open!

<br>

**4. Check your R Version before you start**  

Before you start reproducing examples on StackOverflow, please check if you have R Version 4 installed.
If you use RStudio, your R Version should show up when you start RStudio.

Otherwise use the R.Version function to check:

> `R.Version()`
